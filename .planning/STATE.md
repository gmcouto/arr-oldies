# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-08-23)

**Core value:** Accurately inventory and trace media files across multiple Radarr and Sonarr instances back to their exact History API download/import timestamps, presenting an actionable, sortable audit with audio language filtering and safe, granular execution controls.
**Current focus:** Phase 1: Foundation, Multi-Instance Configuration & CLI Scaffolding
